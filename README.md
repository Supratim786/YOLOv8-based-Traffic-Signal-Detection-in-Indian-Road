In the contemporary era of automation, the
efficient utilization of technology is of paramount importance.
However, despite these advancements, incidents
such as road accidents persist as a critical concern. This
study endeavors to streamline traffic signal detection as a
proactive measure to mitigate road accidents and enhance
road safety. The Smart Traffic Signal Detection System has
been designed to identify traffic signals and proactively
alert drivers, particularly in high-traffic situations. Additionally,
the system assists in monitoring and recording
traffic signal violators, providing valuable data for relevant
authorities. This research introduces a novel system, utilizing
the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm within
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework, to
enhance signal detection accuracy. Real-time data collected
from various locations across the city of Kolkata forms the
foundation for this systemâ€™s development.
